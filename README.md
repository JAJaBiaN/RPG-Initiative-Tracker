This project has become obsolete since the introduction of D&D beyond (an officially licensed product with this functionality and more)

# RPG-Initiative-Tracker
A way to track battles in role playing games. Includes functionality to track conditions.

This code is designed to work from the command line or within a Jupyter notebook.

Feel free to use this in its current form (the Master branch will always work). However, if you want to help this project then please pick a card from the ToDo project or make a request there!
